14 2 32 5 6 
Sample output 1:
74
Explanation of Sample output 1:
The best way to pair the elements is (4, 2), (5, 5), (10,6), (24, 14), (90, 32). The sum of the absolute difference between pairs is  2 + 0 + 4 + 10 + 58 = 74 



class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> minimumAbsDifference(vector<int>& arr) {
      vector<vector<int>> ans;
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int min_diff = arr[1] - arr[0]; // Initialize minimum difference to be between the first two elements
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++) { // Start from the second element
            int diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1];
            if (diff < min_diff) { // If the current difference is smaller than the minimum difference so far
                min_diff = diff; // Update the minimum difference
                ans.clear(); // Clear the result vector since we have a new minimum difference
            }
            if (diff == min_diff) { // If the current difference is equal to the minimum difference
                ans.push_back({arr[i-1], arr[i]}); // Add the pair (arr[i-1], arr[i]) to the result vector
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
